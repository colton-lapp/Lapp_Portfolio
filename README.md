# About me 

My name is Colton Lapp (he/him) and I'm currently a second year Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University studying public policy and data analytics (MSPPM-DA). Prior to attending graduate school, I was considering a career in academic economics and worked as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond for two years. I now have my sights set on doing more applied work at the intersection of policy analysis and data science. Specifically, I'm interested in urban and environmental policy, but am open to working outside of those areas as well. I'm originally from Oregon and California, and I enjoy being outside, spending time with friends and playing/listening to music. 


# What I hope to learn 

After graduation, I'm hoping to work as a data scientist for the government, a research organization or a mission-drive company. In this class, I'm hoping to build upon my current data science skills by learning how to incorporate geospatial data and processes into ML workflows. Part of this involves learning how to better source, process and visualize geospatial data. Another part of this is learning how traditional ML algorithms can be adapted to work in a geospatial context. Overall, I would also just like to learn what opportunities and challenges exist in the intersection of AI/ML and GIS. 

Because I have moderate experience with scripting languages like Python and R, I am also interested in learning how to script GIS processes that are commonly completed in desktop software (like ArcGIS) and accomplish them through code instead. I'm interested in open GIS tools because they seem powerful, affordable, convenient and may integrate better into other tools that I use such as Python.
